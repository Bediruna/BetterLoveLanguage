# Love Languages Quiz

A simple, no-nonsense Love Languages quiz.

## About

I created this project because I wanted a straightforward way to take the Love Languages quiz without encountering annoying ads, payment requests, or unnecessary demands for personal information. It's a small, fun project built out of personal frustration with existing options.

The quiz presents users with a series of scenarios, asking them to choose the option that best resonates with them. Each selection contributes to a tally for a specific love language.

**Please Note:** The quiz scenarios and questions are intended for casual self-exploration and entertainment purposes only. The results may not be a definitive or professionally accurate assessment of your love language.
